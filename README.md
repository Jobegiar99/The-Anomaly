<h3 align = "center"> My final project for the first course of the Michigan State University Game Design and Development Specialization During the course, 
  I had to follow the tutoria to build the base of this game. My specific modifications for the project were:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Write a small story to make the gameplay better </li>
    <li> Implement <a href = "https://github.com/Jobegiar99/Shortest-path-to-exit-random-generated-levels"> the algorithm that I designed to generate levels </a> to generate alien colonies that the player must invade and destroy </li>
    <li> Add a final bos: </li>
    <ul>
      <li> Implement a wandering behavior for the first phase of the boss:
           The first phase  consist of the player having to destroy red spheres in a minute or less. The boss is invisible but wanders around
           the player. Red spheres follow the boss, making them give the player the feel of them wandering around the level </li>
      <li> Use coroutines to control what the boss is doing at every moment of the fight </li>
     
   </ul>
  <li> Add a minimap </li>
  <li> Code a blink effect for the final boss fight by using a coroutine </li>
  <li> Create prefabs to reuse objects </li>
</ul>
